let message = 'Hello!'; // declare the variable and assign the value

alert(message); // Hello!

const message = 'Hello'; // store the string 'Hello' in the variable named message

const message; // this would throw an error

message = 'Hello'; // this would also throw an error

const message = 'Hello!'; // declare the variable and assign the value

message = "World"; // attempt to re-assign: this would throw an error

const message = 'Hello!'; // declare the variable and assign the value

// attempt to re-declare the "message" variable and assign the value 
// this would throw an error too
const message = 'World!';

/*Variables are storage containers for data in code.
Until recently, the var keyword was the only way to create a variable in JavaScript. In newer JavaScript versions, let and const are the convention used to declare variables.
The  let keyword is used to create a variable that can be assigned or re-assigned a new value later on.
The const keyword demands that variables are declared and assigned immediately. A variable cannot be assigned or re-assigned later on.
Multiple variables can be declared using one let statement, but it is recommended to use a single line per variable for better readability.🔍
